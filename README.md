## About

This repo provides the protocol definition for a custom network protocol used for a realtime DAQ system that can be found [here](https://github.com/keshavdv/hermes).

This is intended to be a submodule of other projects that use the Hermes network protocol for communications. Projects should use the `messages.desc` within this submodule to generate associated client libraries.
